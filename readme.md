## Credits
Credits to [Harvey Cabaguio](https://github.com/harveycabaguio/firefox-elementary-theme) for setting the theme up, [h1royuki](https://github.com/h1royuki/firefox-elementary-theme) for the dark mode and the elementary team for the UI design and icons.

## Install

Run bash script:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zonnev/elementaryos-firefox-theme/master/install.sh)
```

Or follow the steps yourself:
1. Go to [about:support](about:support) in Firefox
2. Application Basics > Profile Directory > Open Directory
3. Create a folder named `chrome`
4. Paste the userChrome.css in this folder
5. Disable Title bar in the customization panel in Firefox.
5. In the customization panel in Firefox you can move the new tab button to the left if you wish and use the dark mode option as well.

## To-Do
Either
* Make it respect gtk theme button placement by default  
or
* Customize it to work flawlessly with windows or mac placed (minimise|maximise|close) buttons
